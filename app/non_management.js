        "I’m someone who loves exploring new things and often find myself deep in rabbit holes far outside my domain. I look for small moments of joy and positivity, and I enjoy meaningful conversations just as much as the silly ones. I genuinely enjoy being there for people...not always to advise, but simply to listen. I believe small moments of connection can mean a lot, especially in college when things get overwhelming. Joining the Sunshine initiative felt like a natural step to hopefully help make someone’s journey a little lighter.",
