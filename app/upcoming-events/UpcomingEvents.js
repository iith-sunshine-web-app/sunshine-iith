        "description": "Our recent 'World Mental Health Day' program, hosted by the Sunshine Counseling Cell at IIT Hyderabad, featured two impactful sessions. The first, Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation (JPMR), allowed participants to experience a 40-minute session aimed at reducing stress and anxiety through evidence-based relaxation techniques. The second, a 10-minute journal writing exercise, encouraged self-expression and reflection to enhance mental well-being. Held on 17th October 2023 at LH3, MSME Building, these events brought our community together to focus on mental health and unity. Special thanks to our dedicated student coordinators, Mr. Teja and Ms. Suvitti, for their valuable support. Stay tuned for more enriching events at the Sunshine Counseling Cell."
