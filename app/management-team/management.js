I like helping people, bringing happiness to their face and motivating people. My favourite timepass in college is to spend time with my friends. My journey has started in sunshine when I was in my 2nd year as a mentor. My most heartwarming experience with sunshine was volunteering at the sunshine events. Seeing many happy faces participating in fun activites and relaxing, brought me joy. Apart from this sunshine also provides me the opportunity to connect with people. I really enjoyed being a part of sunshine. So I am here again looking forward for making more memories :)",
